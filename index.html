    Hi I'm Aditya Doshi!

    I am a Mechanical Engineer. 
    Currently I'm on the path to become a web dev & gain practical skills about -> React, node, mongoDB, DS.

    Now my very next goal is to get selected for level-1 in NeoG.camp to learn in depth about full stack development.

    
    Sample Ques 10 from Interview practice

    <p>Open your Github repo. Make a small change. And create a PR. Explain what you understand by Git, what's PR etc.</p>

    <h5>Learning git bash terminal to operate git files- > commits, push, pull....</h5>

    Practice is important.

    Making changes in the new branch, lets check this, working ?
