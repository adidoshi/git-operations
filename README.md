# git operations-steps

Intitializing git repository -> adding files -> commit changes -> publish repository.

Adding README.md file is a good practise which includes the project details. -> You can commit changes after adding a new file or editing and push to github.

Netlify -> select repository from github -> Deloy site.

How a dev in teams work?

1. create branch (you can edit, code you logic, make changes there) -> commit changes -> publish that branch (push) -> now this will not affect your main branch files & will not publish it to Netlify -> this way, you can keep your work in progress safe on github.

1. create a pull request (PR) -> fill the description & details -> get the PR link (PR review), send it to your folks for comment's.

1. after approval -> merge PR -> automatically deploy on netlify -> main branch will be updated.

1. these changes are part of main on github, to get them updated locally on main -> pull the changes from github desktop.

### An important practice while working in industry!!
